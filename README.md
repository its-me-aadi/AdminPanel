It is a copy of the admin-panel of MovEasy, one of the projects I have worked on during my Internship at Wictronix.
You can see see Drivers ,Users and all the orders. You can assign driver to the new orders, verify the drivers. I have used Real Time DataBase of firebase which helps you to see updated data without refreshing the we application.
I haven't made it responsive, as responsiveness was not required.

For cloning project:
git clone https://github.com/its-me-aadi/AdminPanel-MovEasy.git

Install all the required dependencies using:
npm i

After installing the dependencies cd into the main app and run:
npm start
